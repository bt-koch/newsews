\chapter{Modeling Risk with Sentiment Indicator}\label{sec6}
\thispagestyle{empty}

In general, focus on time series models. First, check for statistical significance of overall sentiment score and different sentiment scores by topics. Afterwards, if significant, look at impulse response functions, maybe granger causality and robustness.

\section{Sentiment indicator in predicting CDS}

Adjust \cite{cathcart2020} to banks instead of countries

Problem here: only UBS and CS have CDS... maybe still look at it and extend observation period?\\


\noindent
Hence, look for other models/risk indicators, maybe...

\section{Sentiment indicator in predicting Credit Spreads}

Extend \cite{collin2001} with sentiment indicator to forecast credit spreads


\section{Sentiment in predicting volatility}

Extend a GARCH-M with sentiment score and compare to benchmark GARCH-M to forecast volatility $\rightarrow$ benchmark? i.e. what controls?

\section{maybe: Sentiment indicator in Risk Weighted Assets/Tier 1 Capital}

Is there a "benchmark paper"?
