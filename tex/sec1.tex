Supervisory agencies need to identify weaknesses of the institutions under supervision at an early stage to be able to react in a timely manner. The prevented collapse of the globally active and systematically important Swiss bank Credit Suisse by regulatory interaction in early 2023 have again demonstrated the necessity of banking supervision and the need of quickly reacting to financial distressed banks to sustain financial and general economic stability. A few months prior to the 2023 banking crisis, openAI first launched ChatGPT, providing the general public access to their developed large language model (LLM), drawing huge public attention and has as of August 2024 200 million weekly users \citep{reuters2024}, indicating the huge potential of the application of LLMs, which potentially could improve the banking supervision process. \\

% entscheidungssituation
Banking supervision includes monitoring of a banks' risk management and controls, internal processes and procedures, governance and financial and operational soundness by reviewing banks' internal documents, discussion with banks' personnel and independent analysis \citep{hirtle2022}. As stated in \cite{prenio2024}, supervisory agencies are often faced with limited resources. The Swiss Financial Market Supervision Authority (FINMA) is no exception, which is why it adopts a risk-oriented supervisory approach, concentrating on institutions that demand increased attention due to their supervisory category and a dynamic rating process.\footnote{\url{https://www.finma.ch/en/supervision/banks-and-securities-firms/}} Hence, the decision problem a supervisory agency like the FINMA is confronted with, is the allocation of human resources on institutions to be supervised. \\

% stand der technik
To overcome the resource constraints, supervisory agencies already invest in novel tools based on artificial intelligence (AI) and big data analytics to support their supervisory processes. Following \cite{broeders2018}, this novel methods are referred to as supervisory technology (suptech). As reported in \cite{prenio2024}, a survery conducted by the Financial Stability Institute (FSI) and the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) Innovation Hub in 2023 shows that 47 of the 50 surveyed supervisory agencies have ongoing suptech initiatives, whereby 44 of them have already deployed a suptech tool. An example of a tool discussed in \cite{prenio2024} which is already incorporated in the supervisory process of investment funds is an early warning system, which, among other functionalities, searches the web for relevant information about financial institutions that might signal potential supervisory issues. 

Two other examples of tools mentioned in \cite{prenio2024} are a tool that automates risk annotation for documents submitted by financial institutions and a social media monitoring tool, which aims to analyse public sentiment regarding financial institutions. These tools demonstrate the demand to supplement the existing supervisory process by methodologies to automatically analyse textual data as well as including information from alternative data sources. Both these tools are however not embedded effectively in a supervisors process. \\ \\

% lösungsansatz und resultate
As the 2023 banking crisis and the investments in suptech from supervisory agencies stress the importance of innovative methods of identifying risks in the banking sector and with the rise of LLMs yielding new possibilities, this analysis examines the questions whether LLMs can be applied for monitoring bank risk based on news media sentiment. For this, a news sentiment indicator is constructed using a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model developed by Google researchers in 2018 \citep{devlin2019}, which was further fine-tuned for financial text. Due to its design, the model is able to understand words in context of other words in a sentence and hence is expected to perform better when assessing the sentiment of a text compared to traditional methods. Then, the predictive power of this sentiment indicator for common risk proxies is assessed to determine whether the sentiment indicator is able to forecast the riskiness of the correspondent bank. The results show, that while the news sentiment indicator has some predictive power, some further modifications in constructing the indicator and using it for forecasting would be necessary to implement it in the context of an early warning system. \\


% organization ---
This paper is structured as follows. First, the decision problem a supervisory agency is faced with in their day-to-day work processes is presented. Next, an overview of the literature on the foundations of sentiment analytics in finance, the current research of sentiment analytics relevant in a supervisory context, and the methods used to measure the financial distress of banks is given. In section \ref{sec4}, the methods used to construct the news sentiment indicator are described and its benefits and limitations are discussed. Section \ref{sec5} presents the data used for this analysis, the experimental design and its results, followed by the conclusion in Section \ref{sec6}.
